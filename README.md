In this project, I analyzed a dataset related to electric vehicles (EVs). The dataset contains various features such as electric range, energy consumption, price, and other relevant attributes. The goal is to conduct a thorough analysis to uncover meaningful insights, tell a compelling story, conduct hypothesis testing and provide actionable recommendations based on the data.
